## Git Ð¸ GitHub
Before I have started the Udacity course [try.github.io](http://try.github.io/), I have already known about Git and have familiar with some basic git commands (like push,pull,commit etc.), that help me create repositories and put my projects up on GitHub.
  
In this course it was interesting to listen about what version control is and how git compare to other systems. It was new diff command for me, I don't know that in command lines you can compare two files. It was also useful to know about resolving merge conflicts.  I think it will be useful in future, when I will work on projects with other programmers. I also like short interwiews with programmers on this course. But the middle of Udacity course was a little bit borring for me, there are not a lot of new information and interesting facts for me.
Learn Git branching on [try.github.io](http://try.github.io/) was really excited. I would like edicational animation, that show how really works git commands. I knew a lot of new commands like git cherry pick, rebase, tag, describe.
It was usful to do excersises on the GitHub Learning Lab. It helps me to do this readme more readable and beautiful.
